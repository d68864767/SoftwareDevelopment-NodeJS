```javascript
// This file is for demonstrating infinite iterations in JavaScript.
// It's important to note that infinite iterations can lead to performance issues and should be avoided in production code.

function infiniteLoop() {
    while (true) {
        console.log('This is an infinite loop!');
    }
}

// Uncomment the following line to see the infinite loop in action. Be aware that it will block your program execution.
// infiniteLoop();

module.exports = {
    infiniteLoop
};
