// This file is for demonstrating data protection and privacy in software development.

// 1. Data Minimization
function dataMinimization() {
    console.log("Data minimization involves collecting the least amount of data necessary for the service to function. This reduces the risk of data breaches and helps to build trust with users.");
}

// 2. Anonymization
function anonymization() {
    console.log("Anonymization is the process of removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous.");
}

// 3. Pseudonymization
function pseudonymization() {
    console.log("Pseudonymization is a data management and de-identification procedure by which personally identifiable information fields within a data record are replaced by one or more artificial identifiers, or pseudonyms.");
}

// 4. Encryption
function encryption() {
    console.log("Encryption is a method of converting an original message of regular text into encoded text. The text is encrypted by means of an algorithm (cipher).");
}

// 5. Access Controls
function accessControls() {
    console.log("Access control involves implementing software restrictions that prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.");
}

// 6. Regular Audits
function regularAudits() {
    console.log("Regular audits involve routinely checking and analyzing your systems to ensure data privacy and security measures are working effectively.");
}

// 7. Privacy by Design
function privacyByDesign() {
    console.log("Privacy by design is an approach to systems engineering which takes privacy into account throughout the whole engineering process.");
}

// 8. Transparency
function transparency() {
    console.log("Transparency involves being open with users about how their data is collected, used, and protected.");
}

// 9. User Consent
function userConsent() {
    console.log("User consent involves obtaining permission from users before collecting, using, or sharing their personal data.");
}

// 10. Data Breach Response
function dataBreachResponse() {
    console.log("A data breach response plan is a course of action intended to reduce the risk of unauthorized data access and to mitigate the damage caused if a breach does occur.");
}
