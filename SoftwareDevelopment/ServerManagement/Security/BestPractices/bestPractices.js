// bestPractices.js

// This file is for demonstrating best practices in server security.

// 1. Principle of Least Privilege
function principleOfLeastPrivilege() {
    console.log("The principle of least privilege (PoLP) is a computer security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access necessary to complete his/her job functions.");
}

// 2. Regular Updates
function regularUpdates() {
    console.log("Regular updates are crucial for security. This includes not only the server operating system, but also the software the server is hosting.");
}

// 3. Secure Configurations
function secureConfigurations() {
    console.log("Default configurations of servers are often geared towards usability and not security, making them vulnerable. Always ensure configurations are secure.");
}

// 4. Firewalls
function firewalls() {
    console.log("Firewalls provide a layer of protection by controlling the network traffic coming into and flowing out of your server.");
}

// 5. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
function intrusionDetectionSystems() {
    console.log("Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are tools that can automatically spot suspicious activity and take action.");
}

// 6. Physical Security
function physicalSecurity() {
    console.log("Physical security is just as important as its digital counterpart. Servers should be kept in a secure location to prevent unauthorized access and potential damage.");
}

// 7. Backups
function backups() {
    console.log("Regular backups are crucial. In case of a security incident, backups can be used to restore your system.");
}

// 8. Encryption
function encryption() {
    console.log("Encryption should be used to protect sensitive data. This is particularly important when transmitting data across networks.");
}

// 9. Regular Audits
function regularAudits() {
    console.log("Regular audits can help identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure that the necessary security controls are working as intended.");
}

// 10. Incident Response
function incidentResponse() {
    console.log("Having an incident response plan in place is crucial. This should outline how to respond in the event of a security breach or attack.");
}
