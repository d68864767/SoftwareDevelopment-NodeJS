// This file is for demonstrating the software development lifecycle.

// The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process. 
// It is a structure followed by a development team within the software organization. 
// It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain and replace specific software.

// The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.

// The following are the key stages in the SDLC:

// 1. Requirement collection and analysis
// 2. Feasibility study
// 3. Design
// 4. Coding
// 5. Testing
// 6. Installation/Deployment
// 7. Maintenance

function softwareDevelopmentLifecycle() {
    console.log('1. Requirement collection and analysis');
    console.log('2. Feasibility study');
    console.log('3. Design');
    console.log('4. Coding');
    console.log('5. Testing');
    console.log('6. Installation/Deployment');
    console.log('7. Maintenance');
}
