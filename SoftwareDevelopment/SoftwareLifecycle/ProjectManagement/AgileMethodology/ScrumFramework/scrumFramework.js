// This file is for demonstrating the Scrum framework in Agile methodology.

// Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. 
// It is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products.

// Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems.

// The following are the key components in the Scrum framework:

// 1. Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
// 2. Events: Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
// 3. Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment

function scrumFramework() {
    console.log('1. Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team');
    console.log('2. Events: Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective');
    console.log('3. Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment');
}

module.exports = { scrumFramework };
